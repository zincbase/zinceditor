# ZincEditor

Issue tracker for the web-based ZincEditor tool.

For instruction on how to install and use the tool see [the ZincServer getting started guide](https://github.com/zincbase/zincserver/blob/master/docs/Getting%20started.md).

The source code is currently embedded in the [ZincDB](https://github.com/zincbase/zincdb) repository itself, but may become separated in the future if the library is broken into smaller modules.
